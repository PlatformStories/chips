# chips

A collection of panchromatic (pan), multispectral (ms) and pansharpened (ps) chips, grouped by content, for quick experiments and demos.

All chips are in GeoTiff format and various projections. Multispectral and pansharpened chips are atmospherically compensated.

You can easily manipulate these chips as well as read the associated metadata with [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio).
